# Introduction #

Welcome to the OSID Service Bus wiki site.  Please use these pages to document ideas, suggestions, diagrams, etc. relating to the idea of a service bus based on OSIDs.  In addition to being language independent, [requirements](Requirements.md) include support for messages, transactions, discovery, and federation.  The [architecture](Architecture.md) addressed the following goals.  [Test Cases](TestCases.md) have been added to explore the OSB conceptually.

# Goals #

  * Provide general purpose access to educational services.
  * Demonstrate the power and flexibility of the V3 OSIDs
  * Create a framework that enables cross-language interoperability
  * Provide a platform to build new and useful applications
  * Leverage the work of other organizations and standards

# Things To Do #

Some of the things we need to do to get this project rolling:

  * Capture notes from the first meeting
  * Document the goals of the project
  * Expand the number of participants
  * Determine a good [application name](ApplicationName.md)
  * Looking into Mellon ESB Work http://tid.ithaka.org/enterprise-service-bus-project
