To support this project, MIT has made available a server to assist in testing the service-bus.  The server's URL is `oki-dev.mit.edu`  It is not dedicated to the osid-service-bus, but is shared with other projects.  The server is a VM running 64-bit Redhat Linux. 

Request access to this server by emailing Peter Wilkins (pwilkins in the mit domain)
